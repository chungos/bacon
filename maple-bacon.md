# Description
This is a sweet style smokey bacon recipe

# Basic recipe
- 2 Kg of pork belly( ask butcher to pre-slice! ), not necessary to pre-slice. Personally, can't be bovv'ed to slice. 
- 1/4 cup of brown sugar or demarara recipe
- 1/4 cup of sea salt( don't use iodised salt as its too salty salt...yeah i know...)
- 2 teaspoons of pink salt(sodium nitrite) <- not necessary if pork if known to be superfresh, its for ensuring bacon doesn't turn into fatal bacon
- Maple or hickory or pecan or all woods( just hit bunnigs bbq section )

## Add the following super tasty power-ups 
### For maple maple maple( maple cubed smoked bacon )
- Add 1/4 cup of maple syrup( Syrup not maple flavoured pleaz )
- (Optional)Add a shot of maple finished crown royal Canadian whisky
- Using maple wood to smoke makes it maple maple maple bacon
### For Asian sweet sriracha bacon
- Add 1/8 cup of hoisin and 1/8 cup of sriacha
### Five spice/hoisin aka char siew chinese pork
- Add a table spoon of 5 spice and 1/8 cup of hoison

## Instructions
1. Mix pork, salt, sugar and pink salt in a big bowl or receptacle. 
2. Place bowl or recptable of immature bacon in the fridge for a week. 
3. Get on with your life for 5-10 days and let bacon do its thing. Walk a pracing hill filled with possums, sing a song using only Mongolian throat singing, dress for a fantasy talk show in your mind with CG Jung. If its unsliced flip it each day to let the ingredients soak in. 
4. Take bacon out and smoke it with maple wood. Or hickory, pecan. Or all three woods for about 2+ hours. I usually do a double smoke once first lot of wood turns to ash.
NOTE: Don't worry about soaking the wood. Have found its not necessary. All that whisky would be better served in one's gullet than in wood. 
5. Go crazy and mix 1/4 cup of maple syrup & maple finished crown royal canandian whisky. 
6. Use this to baste the bacon while smoking. OH yeah! 
7. Eat and bask in the joy of one's labours and empirical evidence of a benevolent higher sentience that wants you to be happy.  

# About smoking without a dedicated smoker
- Don't need a dedicated smoker to smoke. 
- Ye can smoke on a bbq like a weber or the stove top using foil and wood
# How is this manner of smoking possible ye conjurer of combustibles?
- Get some foil and roll it out about two a4 sheets
- Place about two handfuls of wood in the foil
- Fold it over into a lil foil capsule
- Stab some holes in the foil 
### For bbbq
- Place it onto bbq rack or hot plate 
- Once it starts smoking place bacon into bbq and put lid on( huzzah we haz smokerz! )
- Forget about it for a few hours
- Return with luvely bacon
### For stove top
- For the stop top option place a mini rack to hold bacon above the foil of wood
- Then place bacon in pot, then put lid on. Smoke away
- Forget about it. Hopefully, lid will keep smoke in and not trigger alarm
- Hooray! We can haz baconz

# Ideas for eating bacon
- Straight outta oven - just eat it as is
- BLT or BLCT( add chicken to bacon lettuce tomato sandwich with mayo) - make it a club three layer, and toast bread in remaining bacon fat
- Get some lurvely sharp, sweet, complex parmagianno reggiano( yes, i can't spelz gud) and make a carbonara fetticine( no cream please)
- A good fry up with eggs cooked in bacon fat, baked beans, some oinky bangers( recipe for another time), tomato, black/white pudding, soda/potato bread and a guiness

# For future recipe experiments
- Mix slow brew coffee, maple, whisky, ghost chilli(!) cure bacon
